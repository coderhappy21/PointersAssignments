#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){

//check the code - 

// int a = 10 , b = 20;
// int *ptr ;
// ptr = 5;

//ans - this code is wrong due to syntax error.

//explanaion - 
//third line is wrong bcz we can,t put a value directly into a pointer
//pointer is only to store addresses of variables
