#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){

int *p,q ; 
//Ans - p is a pointer and q is an interger.


//explanation -
//  so , p is a pointer as we can se according to its syntax we
//  add * there so , computer reads it as int *p ; means, a pointer of name p.

//on the other hand - q is an interger bcz computer reads it as int q;
//means a integer of name q bcz there is no * , and also one thing is that -

//we can,t make multiple pointer at same time like integers.
